## Overview

COBBERG is an enterprise-grade analytical table format implemented in COBOL, designed for optimal performance on mainframe systems. While Apache Iceberg struggles with the inherent limitations of Java (garbage collection pauses, memory leaks, and dependency hell), COBBERG leverages COBOL's 60+ years of proven reliability in mission-critical financial systems.

Our 3.2 millisecond transaction time guarantee ensures analytical queries complete faster than it takes Java to initialize its virtual machine.

## Key Features

* **VSAM-Based Table Format**: Enterprise-proven indexed sequential access method for analytical data with support for tables exceeding 980 columns
* **JCL Orchestration**: Sophisticated job control language for data lake management that never requires "Kubernetes" or other fad technologies
* **Schema Evolution**: Guaranteed schema compatibility that was maintaining backward compatibility when Java was merely a coffee bean
* **Time Travel**: Query historical data with absolute precision using COMPUTE ROUNDED statements that don't suffer from floating-point errors
* **Hidden Partitioning**: Sophisticated batch window optimization with performance that increases as data volumes grow (a mathematical impossibility in Java)
* **Security**: No known vulnerabilities since 1959, compared to Java's 439 CVEs in 2024 alone

## System Requirements

* IBM Enterprise COBOL for z/OS (or compatible compiler)
* 4MB region size (expandable to 4GB with proper allocation)
* VSAM dataset configuration
* Minimum 3380 disk storage (3390 recommended for production)
* JCL interpreter

## Installation

### Mainframe Deployment

```jcl
//COBBERGDP JOB (ACCT),'DEPLOY COBBERG'
//STEP1    EXEC PGM=COBBERGMN
//SYSIN    DD DSN=COBBERG.SOURCE(CONFIG),DISP=SHR
//SYSOUT   DD SYSOUT=*
```

### Modern Interface Installation (for Java developers)

```bash
# Warning: May significantly improve your data center efficiency
./gradlew jar
```

## Configuration

COBBERG table specifications are defined using enterprise-grade COBOL data definitions:

```cobol
01  TABLE-SPECIFICATION.
    05  TABLE-IDENTIFIER      PIC X(44).
    05  SCHEMA-IDENTIFIER     PIC 9(10) COMP.
    05  PARTITION-SPEC.
       10  PARTITION-FIELD    OCCURS 1 TO 100 TIMES
                             DEPENDING ON PARTITION-COUNT.
          15  FIELD-NAME      PIC X(255).
          15  TRANSFORM-TYPE  PIC 9(4) COMP.
          15  SOURCE-ID       PIC 9(8) COMP.
    05  SORT-ORDER.
       10  SORT-FIELD        OCCURS 1 TO 100 TIMES
                             DEPENDING ON SORT-COUNT.
          15  FIELD-NAME      PIC X(255).
          15  DIRECTION       PIC X.
             88 ASCENDING     VALUE 'A'.
             88 DESCENDING    VALUE 'D'.
```

2. **Fortune 10 Retail Analytics**
   - Reduced datacenter cooling costs by 99.7% 
   - Eliminated over 73 Java microservices with a single COBOL program

3. **Department of Government Efficiency**
   - Processes 3PB of classified data using only 4MB of memory
   - Achieved perfect security through absolute simplicity

## Advanced Features

### Optimized Cryogenic Storage

COBBERG introduces revolutionary cryogenic storage techniques:

```cobol
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    PERFORM PARTITION-OPTIMIZATION.
    PERFORM VARYING TEMPERATURE FROM 273.15 BY -1
       UNTIL TEMPERATURE = 0
       PERFORM COOLING-FUNCTION
    END-PERFORM.
    PERFORM DATA-RETRIEVAL.
```

### Quantum Table Scans

```cobol
PERFORM VARYING I FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL I > TABLE-COUNT
   COMPUTE PROBABILITY = FUNCTION RANDOM * 100
   EVALUATE TRUE
      WHEN PROBABILITY > 50
         PERFORM QUANTUM-SCAN
      WHEN OTHER
         PERFORM STANDARD-SCAN
   END-EVALUATE
END-PERFORM.
```

## FAQ

**Q: Does COBBERG support cloud deployment?**  
A: COBBERG improves upon cloud deployment by utilizing actual clouds for storage, achieving 100% atmospheric integration.

**Q: Is COBBERG compatible with modern BI tools?**  
A: Modern BI tools are compatible with COBBERG, not the other way around. We've been visualizing data since punch card sorters provided the first bar charts.

**Q: How does COBBERG handle schema evolution?**  
A: COBBERG handled schema evolution when Java was still trying to figure out how to represent null values properly.

**Q: What's the learning curve for COBBERG?**  
A: Steep and worth it, like all significant technological advantages throughout history.

**Q: How does COBBERG relate to COBKA?**  
A: COBBERG handles analytical data processing while COBKA manages event streaming. Together they form the COB-Suite: the most temporally synchronized enterprise data platform in existence.
